industry. Therefore, digital apparel specialist at Alvanon

In order to bring Alvanon 3D revolution project into the
next step, Alvanon need to have a basic prototype portal
for fashion designers to access all different kinds of mannequins.
This is where me and Sam (another UX designer)
joint together to design the portal.

**There are two main objectives in this project**
- To create a MVP for stakeholders to understand how their investments will be used.
- To create a user-friendly portal for fashion designers to easily search the suitable mannequins and download right away.
